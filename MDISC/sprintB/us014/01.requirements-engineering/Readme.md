# US014 - Running Asymptotic Behavior Tests


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a QAM, I want to run tests for inputs of variable size, to
observe the asymptotic behavior of the execution time of the US13 algorithm.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria 

* **AC1:** The graphic referring to the asymptotic behavior of the execution running time tests should be presented in a time unit
  that allows to distinguish the running times of all tested examples.
* **AC2:** Ensure that all execution times (both recorded and displayed) are consistently measured in the chosen time unit (e.g., milliseconds or seconds).
* **AC3:** The system should ensure that only QA Managers have permission to execute asymptotic behavior tests.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency on "US013 - Optimizing irrigation" since the algorithm must already be created.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* ? O GESTOR QUE VAI COLOCAR OS INPUTS PARA OS TESTES OU JÁ VAI ESTAR PRESENTE NO CODIGO?

**Output Data:**

* ? UM GRAFICO? O QUE EXATAMENTE?
