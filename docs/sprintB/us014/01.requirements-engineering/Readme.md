# US014 - Running Asymptotic Behavior Tests


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a QAM, I want to run tests for inputs of variable size, to
observe the asymptotic behavior of the execution time of the US13 algorithm.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria 

* **AC1:** The graphic referring to the asymptotic behavior of the execution running time tests should be presented in a time unit
  that allows to distinguish the running times of all tested examples.
* **AC2:** 
* **AC2:** 


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency on "US013 - Optimizing irrigation" as there must be at least one skill created.
