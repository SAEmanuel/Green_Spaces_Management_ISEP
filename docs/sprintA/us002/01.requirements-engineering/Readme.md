## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Human Resources Manager I want to register a job.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

>	Each task is characterized by having a unique reference per organization, a designation, an informal and a technical description, an estimated duration and cost, as well as a task category. 

>	As long as it is not published, access to the task is exclusive to the employees of the respective organization. 

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Which is the unit of measurement used to estimate duration?
>
> **Answer:** Duration is estimated in days.

> **Question:** Monetary data is expressed in any particular currency?
>
> **Answer:** Monetary data (e.g. estimated cost of a task) is indicated in POT (virtual currency internal to the platform).
