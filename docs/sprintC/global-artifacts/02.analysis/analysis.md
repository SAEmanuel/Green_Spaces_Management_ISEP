* VFM registers multiple CheckUp.

* HRM registers multiple Skill.
* HRM registers multiple Job.
* HRM registers multiple Collaborator.
* HRM generates multiple Team.

* Collaborator has one Job

---

**Places**

* GreenSpace contains Garden.
* GreenSpace contains Medium-sized park.
* GreenSpace contains Large-sized park.

---

**Noteworthy Events**

* MusgoSublime manages green spaces, which are used by GSU and managed by GSM. This system has collaborators who have a
  job and skills assigned to them which are registered by HRM.
  HRM also generates teams composed by collaborators. These teams have an agenda to follow defined by tasks. They also
  use vehicles (registered by VFM) who can transport equipment and machines.
  These vehicles need a periodical check-up (defined by VFM), the system informs the VFM of what vehicles need check-up,
  he may select the ones he wants and registers the overhauling.

**Physical Objects**

* Vehicle transports Equipment
* Vehicle transports Machine
* Vehicle is registered by VFM

**Descriptions of Things**

* Agenda defines multiple Task
* Skill is assigned to multiple Collaborator
* Task requires multiple Skill
* Task requires multiple Job
