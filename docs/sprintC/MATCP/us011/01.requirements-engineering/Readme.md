# US011 - Collect data from the user portal about the use of the park


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a GSM, I want to be able to collect data from the user portal
about the use of the park, so that I may understand the use of the park
by different age groups.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document and client meetings:**

> Indicate the proportion of users from each age group who would
recommend the park to others.

> Create a boxplot for each age group, regarding the monthly frequency of use of the park, and draw the main conclusions obtained
from this type of graph.
In the elaboration of the US09 to US11 the following acceptance criteria
will be considered:

> Programming Language: Python

> Development environment: Jupyter Notebook
9

> Work delivery format: A single Jupyter Notebook file, which contains
all the work carried out.

> At the end of the file, you must indicate the contribution (in %) of each
member of the group to the development of the work (the sum of all
percentages must be 100%).
